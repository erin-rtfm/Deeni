# Lesson 3: And you?

## Conversation
| | Deeni | English |
|---|---|---|
| Erin | Ch"eela, Ch"uudi! Daa’eela dee-dint-nish? | Hello, Judy! How are you? |
| Judy | Shu’! | Well! |
| | Nvnchu? | And you? |
| Erin | Shiichu shvm. | I’m good, too. |

## Grammar Notes
### Also
_Nvnchu_ means _you also._ _Shiichu_ means _me also._

- Nvn: You
- Shii: I, me
- Chu: Also

### Words as sentences
You can say _shu’_ and _shvm_ on their own when the verb or noun is implied. In the example above, Judy says _shu’_ alone because the question “How are you?” indicates the way she’ll answer – about herself.

### “How are you?”
In this example, _daa’eela dee-dint-nish_ is translated as _how are you?_ This is a more relaxed translation.
