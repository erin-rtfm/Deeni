# Lesson 1: How are you?

## Conversation
| | Deeni | English |
|---|---|---|
| Erin | Ch"eela, Ch"uudi! | Hello, Judy! |
| | Daa’eela dee-dint-nish? | How are you? |
| Judy | Shu’ dee-dvsht-nish. | I’m feeling well. |

## Grammar Notes

### Question Words
Just like English, Deeni has several question words. In this lesson, we learned _daa’eela_ – _how._

### Sentence order
Every language has a particular word order. In English, the order is subject–verb–object. 

- The subject is what the sentence is about, or the thing in the sentence that’s doing the action.
- The object is what the thing in the sentence that has an action done to it.
- The verb is the action.

For example, in the English sentence “I read books”:

- I is the subject – it’s what the sentence is about.
- Read is the verb – it’s the action.
- Books is the object – it’s the thing that has the action done to it.

In Deeni, sentences go in the order subject–object–verb. “I read books” in Deeni would be in the order _I books read_.

### Verbs
_Dee-d[]t-nish_ is the stem verb meaning _feel._

- To say _I feel_, add _vsh_ between the brackets: _dee-d[vsh]t-nish_ :arrow_right: _dee-dvsht-nish_
- To say _you feel_, add _in_ between the brackets: _dee-d[in]t-nish_ :arrow_right: _dee-dint-nish_

Therefore, _Daa’eela dee-dint-nish?_ literally means _How do you feel?_.
