## Grammar Notes

### Verbs
In this lesson we’re encountering a new kind of verb: the double split verb.

Just like split verbs, double split verbs have a conjugation in the middle, typically on the second syllable. They also use the same conjugation sounds that split verbs do. But instead of a clean break in the middle of a syllable, double split verbs may develop an additional syllable based on the specific way the conjugation sound splits.

_D[]n[]-tr’at_ is the stem verb meaning _sick_.
