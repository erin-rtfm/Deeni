# Sounds and Spelling: Introduction
Traditionally, Deeni did not have a written component, so there is no traditional writing style. Instead, several people worked to develop a writing system in the 1970s and '80s. The most current draft of that system is called the "Practical Alphabet," which is designed to capture Deeni phonetics in a way that can be typed on a standard English keyboard. 

I break from the Practical Alphabet in a few small ways:
- I do not use hyphens in the Deeni Project except in verbs and where they help differentiate between a word and its prefixes or suffixes. I find hyphens makes words no easier to read but much harder to type.
- Rather than using an apostrophe (') as the marker for both glottal stops and ejectives, I use apostrophes only for glottal stops. I use a double quote (") for ejectives. (More on the difference between them below.)

> Although it's important to know how to read, languages live and die on people speaking aloud to one another. Because of that, if you want to practice and improve your Deeni, it's vital to practice saying words out loud. I've done my best here to explain the sounds you'll encounter as you study, but I strongly suggest watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UN7rABDQqI) featuring Loren Bommelyn of the Tolowa Rancheria. I've also provided links to recordings of individual sounds to make it faster and easier to find the ones you want to practice.

# The Practical Alphabet
## Vowels

### Basic Vowels
| Deeni letter | Sound | Sound clip | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| a | "a" as in _father_ | [>>](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/Open_central_unrounded_vowel.ogg) | ta'  (_father_)|
| au | "ow" as in _cow_ | [>>](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/En-us-ow.ogg) | gau (_swan_) |
| ay | "i" as in _mine_ | [>>](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/En-us-eye.ogg) | day (_what_) |
| e | "ai" as in _rain_ | [>>](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/Close-mid_front_unrounded_vowel.ogg) | n'ee (_land_) |
| i | "ee" as in _free_ | [>>](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Close_front_unrounded_vowel.ogg) | disne (_man_)
| oy | "oy" as in _boy_ | [>>](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/En-us-oi2.ogg) | moyn (_edge_) |
| u | "oo" as in _boot_ | [>>](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Close_back_rounded_vowel.ogg) | sru' (_grandmother_)
| v | "u" as in _gut_  | [>>](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/PR-open-mid_back_unrounded_vowel2.ogg) | mvn (_house_)

### Extensions
Deeni distinguishes between "long" and "short" vowels. You can think of short vowels as taking one "beat" in the word, while a long vowel takes two "beats." We don't have a similar concept in formal English, but you can think of it as the difference between "Wow!" and "Woooow!" The second is held for a little longer - in English for emphasis, in Deeni for meaning.

Short vowels are represented by one letter. The only exception are the diphthongs (au, ay, and oy), which always have two letter. For example:
- ta' (_father_)
- gau (_swan_)
- day (_what_)
- telh (_flat, broad_)
- mish (_nose_)
- moyn (_edge_)
- sru' (_grandmother_)
- dvt (_where_)

Long vowels are represented by two of the same letter. The two letters together (for example, "ee") mean that you hold out the sound for twice as long. For example:
- n'ee (_land_)
- lhchaa~ (_rain_)
- k"wee (_over_)

Words can have a mix of long and short vowels. When this happens, the long vowels almost always come at the beginning of the word, with a short vowel at the end.
- deesre (_sister_)
- buusri (_cat_)
- deedvn (_when_)

### Nazalization
A "nasal" sound is when you make noise by passing air through your nose rather than through your mouth. For example, when you hum, no air comes out of your mouth - instead, you make a noise in your throat and all the air comes out of your nose. (Put your hand under your nostrils and hum a little of your favorite tune to see what I mean.)

In Deeni, the vowels _a_ and _i_ can be nasalized for meaning. We write that with a tilde (~) symbol. For example:
- xuucha~ (_blessed_)
- si~sxa (_sea_)

In addition to the short nasal vowels above, you can also have long nasal vowels:
- haa~chu (_goose_)
- nii~dash (_you dance_)

You can also have more than one nasal vowel in a single word:
- nii~li ~' (_rapids_)
