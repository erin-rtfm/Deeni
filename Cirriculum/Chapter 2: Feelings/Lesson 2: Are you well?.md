## Grammar Notes

### Good
_Shvm_ means _good_. It is an adjective. This means it describes a noun (person, place, thing, or idea). It always comes after the thing it talks about.

- Xvsh shvm: Good person
- Mvntaadvn shvm: Good city
- Srtaa~ shvm: Good food

### Verbs
In Deeni, we very rarely uses the words _is_, _am_, and _are_. Instead, verbs usually have the person and timing conjugated in. However, sometimes is, am, and are make sense.

_N[]-li_ is the stem verb meaning is. Although it is a split verb, the split happens on the first syllable. Therefore, it’s a 1-split verb.

- To say I am, add vs between the brackets: _n[vs]-li_ :arrow-right: _nvs-li_
- To say you are, add ii~ between the brackets: _n[ii~]-li_ :arrow-right: _nii~li_

Therefore, _Shu’ haa nii~-li_ literally means _Well that-way are you?_
